            <p>
              The website is well organized and neatly designed in appearance and has a horizontal and vertical navigation across all of its pages. When we click any navigation menu from homepage it changes the color in horizontal navigation bar and adds two navigation menus in the right end of horizontal navigation & it also changes the hovering color in the vertical navigation bar. 
Footer also varies from the home page to other pages. Apart from that, all other things remain consistent like fonts, and themes. It also uses consistent navigation formats.

            </p>
            <li>Color</li>
            <p>
             Most of the colors don’t complement each other, however they are easily identifiable due to their distinctive appearance. Monochrome schemes are not used. Also, the website is designed as dark text on light background.
            </p>
            <li>Freshness</li>
            <p>
             The website feels, that it has regularly updated whenever there had been any changes needed. However, the documents that they use are pretty old but had been constantly updated parts of its documents.  As this website is created in the year 1999 and it still caught up with somewhat of the dynamic designs available in the industry

            <li>Quick Loading</li>
            <p>
              The website feels that its fast because of its quick loading.  Images are rarely used in this website. Those images used are set to fast loading. However, the website doesn’t respond to the user when there is something is already loading.
            </p>
            <li>Contextual Clues</li>
            <p>
             The website is consistent in nature. Users are able to recognize whether they are still on the website or not. This site has provided sufficient navigation and clues as to where the users can go in.
            </p>

            <li>Feedback</li>
            <p>
              The website provides a way for the user to report any error if they notice by simply clicking the REPORT ERROR in the bottom of all the pages. It also provides a FORUM for their website to discuss the problems or issues they use face. But they don’t provide any phone numbers, or FAQ sections. 
            </p>
          </ol>
        </ol>

         Evaluation: In my opinion, the site has followed the design guidelines to its average and has a lot to improve in terms of its freshness and its overall design.

            <li>Consistency</li>
            <p>
             The website is consistent in appearance and has a horizontal navigation bar available in all of its pages. All the tabs in the navigation bar consist of dropdown list regarding the particular area regarding the tab.  It is sufficient that we just have to hover over navigation bar tab to see the dropdown list. When we click any listed item from the dropdown list, it will take us to the following page with a vertical navigation bar with much more item list. 
Footer is constant for all the pages, they have used same background image for the footer in all the pages and the footer text also remains the same.

            </p>
            <li>Color</li>

            <p>
              Color used in this website are bright contrast in nature with light dark text. Which makes the text easily visible and make the appearance good. Monochrome schemes are not used.
            </p>

            <li>Freshness</li>
            <p>
              The website feels up to date because it displays the time each content gets updated. For e.g. the course pages display the last time it was accessed. However, the website doesn’t have any footer that displays when the website was updated recently or created date.

            <li>Quick Loading</li>
            <p>
              Website is not much quick loading as it contains slider in the homepage below the navigation and lots of other visual contents and small sliders. All together it makes the loading a bit slower
            </p>

            <li>Contextual Clues</li>

            <p>
              As the website provides many helpful navigation menu’s and other detailed links which helps the user to have much better clue on where he have to go for fetching some particular info.
            </p>

            <li>Feedback</li>

            <p>
             The website provides a way for the user to ask any questions or queries regarding any material provided in their website through a feedback link in the bottom of the page. 
            </p>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Evaluation: In my opinion, the site has obeyed the design guidelines to good extent and has a good usability design that can be improved by making it more easy to use and less cluttered.

            <li>Consistency</li>
            <p>
              The website is consistent in appearance and has a horizontal navigation across all of its pages. It uses consistent colors, fonts, and themes. It also uses consistent navigation formats. Some pages have their own distinctive sections and styles in order
              to provide more information about that particular page. For e.g.. The homepage has sections such as ‘News’, ‘Discover’ etc. that are not visible in other pages that have their own sections.
            </p>

            <li>Color</li>

            <p>
              The website colors complement each other and they are easily identifiable due to their distinctive appearance. The website uses mainly blue color but not completely in a monochromatic style. Also, the website uses both dark text on light background and
              light text on dark background.
            </p>

            <li>Freshness</li>

            <p>
              The website feels updated because it displays the current year in its footer. Also, the website contents are up to date.

            <li>Quick Loading</li>
            <p>
              Considering the previous two websites, this website feels notably slower because it has more contents such as large images and videos. When looked into Inspect Element &gt; Network, it shows that the images and content have been optimized for fast loading,
              however due to many multimedia elements, the website is a little slower. Also, the website uses thumbnails when appropriate. However, the website has not provided any feedbacks when waiting is required.
            </p>

            <li>Contextual Clues</li>

            <p>
              The website is consistent. Users are able to identify if they are still on the site or not. The website has provided obvious navigation and clues as to where the users can go in. Also, it uses an identifiable design layout.
            </p>

            <li>Feedback</li>

            <p>
              The website provides a way for the user to give feedback and/or get help. It uses a form that can be filled and submitted to send feedbacks and help queries.
            </p>
          </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Evaluation: In my opinion, the site has obeyed the design guidelines to great extent and is designed professionally with consideration of the user’s usability. The website could further optimize its contents to make it load faster on slower networks.
